I'm a first-year PhD Student in Computer Science at Washington State University under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://htnghia87.github.io/">Nghia Hoang</a>. I graduated from Hanoi University of Science and Technology with a bachelor in Applied Mathematics and Informatics. During my undergrad, I was fortunate to be an AI research resident at FPT Software in Hanoi, Vietnam.

I'm interested in probabilistic machine learning with a focus on uncertainty quantification and applications in scientific domains. Currently, I am also conducting reasearch on foundation model adaptation, focusing on continual learning and model merging.
